    <h1>JavaScript course - JS exercises: Revision 01</h1>

    <p><a href="/index.html">back to overview</a></p>   

    <div class="narrow-container">

        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Here you will find the description of the JavaScript revision 01 exercise. The goal is simple. Create a form that does one simple thing: it collects emails.</p>

        <p>It looks like this, and this is what it does:</p>

        <div class="email-subscription">

            <div class="email-subscription-container">
                <form id="email-subscription-form" method="POST">

                    <div>
                        <h2 class="hero-header">subscribe</h2>
                        <p class="hero-subscript">Get connected to your future</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="inputs">
                        <input type="email" name="subscription-email" placeholder="enter you email address now..."><!--
                        --><input type="submit">
                    </div>
        
                </form>
            </div>
            

        </div>

        <p>As you have noticed, you have a working example here. So you have the option: either you try to copy it as accuratly as possible without looking at the code or you copy the code. Either way, if you get it to work exactly as the example above, you will learn something.</p>

        <h2>How do I even... ?</h2>

        <p>I'm no designer, so I look online for examples I like and try to mimick them as best as possible. Here's the example I used: <a href="https://www.codehim.com/bootstrap/bootstrap-email-subscription-form/">https://www.codehim.com/bootstrap/bootstrap-email-subscription-form/</a></p>
        <p>I chose this example explicitly because it also has the design in code. I didn't look at it, because I don't want to let it influence my thinking. Only afterwards did I look at the code to compare what I liked best about their code and what I liked more about my own.</p>

        <p>So not only do you learn to code by mimicking, also do you learn by comparing. By doing so experience will come automatically.</p>

        <p>With experience comes craftmanship and routine. You might think this revision exercise is a daunting task. Don't be alarmed, it is. It's also a learning experience. Set your own goals and see how far you can reach them. Even if you never, ever plan on becoming a developer, you get the opportunity to experience how it is to be one, even just momentarily.</p>
        
        <p>You will meet many developers in your life, in many shapes and forms. You will think of this course when you do and you'll be able to make a connection... if you do this exercise right at least.</p>
